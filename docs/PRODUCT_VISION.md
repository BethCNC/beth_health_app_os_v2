# Product Vision

## Purpose
Build a personal EMR-style app with an Epic-inspired UI and workflow for learning and prototyping using dummy data only.

## Target Users
- Individual developers and designers exploring EMR-style workflows
- Internal demos for UI and data modeling

## Success Criteria
- Epic-like shell: left nav, patient context header, tabbed workspace
- All data access routed through src/lib/data
- Domain types centralized in src/lib/domain
- No real PHI or live integrations
