# Accessibility Spec

## Standards
- WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for all patient and clinician surfaces.

## Mandatory Behaviors

- Visible focus states on all interactives.
- Reduced motion support enabled by default.
- No auto-advancing or flashing UI.

## Neurodivergent-Friendly Defaults
- Stable layout and predictable route structure.
- Plain language labels and concise error copy.
- Chunked information architecture with progressive disclosure.

## Verification
- Run keyboard traversal checks for records/timeline/verification/share.
- Validate screen-reader labels on nav and tables.
