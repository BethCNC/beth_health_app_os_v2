You are working on a Personal EMR (Epic-like) app.

Constraints:
- Dummy data only. Never use real PHI.
- UI never calls Firestore directly.
- Data access must be in src/lib/data.
- Domain types and schemas are in src/lib/domain.

UX goals:
- Left navigation
- Patient context header
- Workspace tabs: Summary, Timeline, Labs, Medications, Documents
