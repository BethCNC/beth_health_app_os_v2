Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information\nin my note to you as I should have. I should have said that I\nsuspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's\nis only 1 way this can happen). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can\nsometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to\nsometimes become more prominent). I do want you to proceed\nwith the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in\nfor one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then\nI would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review\nhow to proceed from there. If the MRI does not confirm Grave's\ndisease, then you should get TSH and free T4 every 3 months for\nthe next year.\nResults\nPerformed at: 01 - LabCorp Burlington\n1447 York Court, Burlington, NC 272153361\nLab Director: William F Hancock MD, Phone: 8007624344\nWBC RBC\nNormal range: 3.4 - 10.8 x10E3/uL Normal range: 3.77 - 5.28 x10E6/uL\n8.2 4.57\n3.4 10.8 3.77 5.28\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/app/test-results/details?pageMode=1&eorderid=WP-240bp3BSKzEcB6t8qcdt-2F3oA-3D-3D-24L9vfQF4k5MdP69bXsv… 1/3\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n10/25/24, 8:34 PM MyAtriumHealth - Test Details\nHemoglobin Hematocrit\nNormal range: 11.1 - 15.9 g/dL Normal range: 34.0 - 46.6 %\n13.0 37.8\n11.1 15.9 34 46.6\nMCV MCH\nNormal range: 79 - 97 fL Normal range: 26.6 - 33.0 pg\n83 28.4\n79 97 26.6 33\nMCHC RDW\nNormal range: 31.5 - 35.7 g/dL Normal range: 12.3 - 15.4 %\n34.4 15.0\n31.5 35.7 12.3 15.4\nPlatelet Count Neutrophils\nNormal range: 150 - 379 x10E3/uL Normal value: Not Estab. %\n230\nValue\n64\n150 379\nLymphs Relative Monocytes\nNormal value: Not Estab. % Normal value: Not Estab. %\nValue Value\n27 8\nEos Relative Basos Relative\nNormal value: Not Estab. % Normal value: Not Estab. %\nValue Value\n1 0\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/app/test-results/details?pageMode=1&eorderid=WP-240bp3BSKzEcB6t8qcdt-2F3oA-3D-3D-24L9vfQF4k5MdP69bXsv… 2/3\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n10/25/24, 8:34 PM MyAtriumHealth - Test Details\nNeutrophils Absolute Lymphocytes Absolute\nNormal range: 1.4 - 7.0 x10E3/uL Normal range: 0.7 - 3.1 x10E3/uL\n5.2 2.2\n1.4 7 0.7 3.1\nMonocytes Absolute Eosinophils Absolute\nNormal range: 0.1 - 0.9 x10E3/uL Normal range: 0.0 - 0.4 x10E3/uL\n0.7 0.1\n0.1 0.9 0 0.4\nBasophils Absolute Immature Granulocytes\nNormal range: 0.0 - 0.2 x10E3/uL Normal value: Not Estab. %\n0.0\nValue\n0\n0 0.2\nImmature Grans (Abs)\nNormal range: 0.0 - 0.1 x10E3/uL\n0.0\n0 0.1\nAuthorizing provider: Gina LiCause\nCollection date: February 14, 2018 4:55 PM\nSpecimens: Blood\nResult date: February 15, 2018 12:37 PM\nResult status: Final\nResulting lab:\nLABCORP\nMyChart® licensed from Epic Systems Corporation© 1999 - 2024\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/app/test-results/details?pageMode=1&eorderid=WP-240bp3BSKzEcB6t8qcdt-2F3oA-3D-3D-24L9vfQF4k5MdP69bXsv… 3/3",

Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information\nin my note to you as I should have. I should have said that I\nsuspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's\nis only 1 way this can happen). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can\nsometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to\nsometimes become more prominent). I do want you to proceed\nwith the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in\nfor one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then\nI would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review\nhow to proceed from there.

Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information\nin my note to you as I should have. I should have said that I\nsuspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's\nis only 1 way this can happen). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can\nsometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to\nsometimes become more prominent). I do want you to proceed\nwith the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in\nfor one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then\nI would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review\nhow to proceed from there.
