She was also diagnosed\nwith Graves' eye disease, although there were conflicting opinions between\nher eye doctor (Dr. Donald Stewart) her other providers about whether all\nher findings were due to Graves' disease. She has not seen Dr. Stewart in\n~2 years and has been told he is retiring. She never received specific\ntreatment for her Graves' disease and thyroid levels subsequently\nnormalized, though notably was started on Methotrexate for arthritis around\nthis time as well. Notably she had also been placed on Lithium about 18\nmonths prior, though was only on it temporarily.\nShe experiences constant pressure in her right eye, which she believes is\ndue to increased exposure to dirt and irritants. She also reports pulsatile\ntinnitus and a whooshing sensation in her ears, which started after a CT\nscan in 01/2025\nHer thyroid function tests have consistently shown elevated TPO antibodies,\nand earlier this year she had 2 elevated TSH levels in a row, but has not\nstarted thyroid hormone replacement.\nThis has exacerbated the pressure in her head and eye. She reports\nirregular body temperature regulation, often feeling overheated and\nexperiencing rashes. She also reports both constipation and diarrhea, and\nirregular digestion. Her periods are regular now, although they were not\nduring her adolescence. She has gained 30 pounds in 3 months, which she\nattributes to being bedridden due to arm issues. She has been almost\nbedridden due to arm issues, which limit her mobility to 1 or 2 hours a day.\nShe experiences hair loss in certain areas and has had a staph infection on\nher face for 5 years, which has spread to her body. She has very dry and\nirritable skin.\nShe was recently diagnosed with hypermobile EDS a year ago. The mast\ncell issues started in 01/2025 after a bad reaction to a contrast dye. She\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/Visits 1/5\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n9/3/25, 2:34 AM MyChart - Past Visit Details\nsaw a mast cell specialist 2 days ago and has had cardiology, colonoscopy,\nendoscopy, and gastric emptying tests this year.\nShe is currently transitioning from instant release to extended release\nAdderall under the supervision of her psychiatrist. She has been prescribed\nlow-dose naltrexone, which she will start soon. She is also taking\nantihistamines.\nShe has a history of hyperthyroidism in her family, with several cousins\nhaving thyroid issues.\nShe reports no amiodarone use or biotin use.\nROS: See HPI for pertinent positives/negatives, otherwise a complete\nreview of systems is negative\nReviewed and updated this visit by provider:\nTobacco | Allergies | Meds | Problems | Med Hx | Surg Hx | Fam Hx |\nPDMP |\nPE:\nBP 122/84 (BP Location: Left Upper Arm, Patient Position: Sitting) | Pulse\n99 | Ht 5' 3\" (1.6 m) | Wt 144 lb 12.8 oz (65.7 kg) | LMP 08/27/2025 (Exact\nDate) | SpO2 98% | BMI 25.65 kg/m²\nGen: Healthy appearing, NAD\nHEENT: NCAT.

I see no intra or extraconal mass lesion to account for this, and the\norbital fat is preserved. The extraocular muscles are unremarkable. Slight\nasymmetric inward\nbowing of the left medial orbital wall suggests a possible remote left orbital\ninjury. There is also opacification of a left posterior ethmoid cell with\nopacification of adjacent portions of a septated left sphenoid cell. Mild\nmucosal thickening is seen\nelsewhere within the ethmoids. No fluid level.\nThe visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Orbital asymmetry as described.

Hypothyroidism.\n- Her last few TSH levels were elevated, indicating hypothyroidism. The\nTPO antibody has been consistently positive, suggesting a shift from\nGraves' disease to Hashimoto's over time. Lithium can trigger thyroid\nimmune disorders and may have contributed to her initial presentation.\n- Levothyroxine will be prescribed with final dose TBD pending repeat TSH\ntoday. The generic formulation will be tried first due to cost considerations. If\nshe experiences any reactions, she can message via MyChart and an\nalternate formulation such as Tirosint can be tried\n- A new baseline TSH level will be obtained before deciding on the\nlevothyroxine dosage. The results will be shared via MyChart. A lab recheck\nwill be scheduled in about 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of the\nstarting dose.\n2. Thyroid eye disease.\n- She reports persistent swelling in her right eye, which may be related to\nher thyroid condition.\n- A referral to Dr. Pietraszkiewicz will be made for further evaluation of her\neye condition, and TSH and TRAb levels will be assessed today\nFollow-up: 6-week lab-only visit and a 6-month office visit.\nOrders Placed This Encounter\nProcedures\n• TSH Rfx on Abnormal to Free T4\nStanding Status: Future\nNumber of Occurrences: 1\nExpiration Date: 8/28/2026\n• Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin\nStanding Status: Future\nNumber of Occurrences: 1\nExpiration Date: 8/28/2026\n• Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody\nStanding Status: Future\nNumber of Occurrences: 1\nExpiration Date: 8/28/2026\n• Ambulatory referral to Ophthalmology\nReferral Priority: Routine\nReferral Type: Consultation\nReferral Reason: Evaluate and Return\nReferred to Provider: Alexandra A Pietraszkiewicz, MD\nRequested Specialty: Ophthalmology\nNumber of Visits Requested: 1\nExpiration Date: 2/23/2026\nRequested Prescriptions\nNo prescriptions requested or ordered in this encounter\nAdva T Eisenberg, MD\n08/29/2025, 11:14 AM\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/Visits 4/5\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n9/3/25, 2:34 AM MyChart - Past Visit Details\nComputer technology was used to create visit note.

Vaccine counseling\nReviewed\n12. Screening for lipid disorders\n- Lipid Panel\n**Main ongoing concerns revolve around POTS, EDS. Now also with concern for MCAS after possible\nreaction to contrast or recent CT scan. She did bring in several page letter outlining ongoing symptoms\nincluding joint and muscle pains, face and head flushing, persistent brain fog, extreme fatigue, head\npressure, itchy and watery eyes. She does feel like some of her symptoms were significantly improved with\nlarge amounts of antihistamines. She has been taking Claritin and Zyrtec once or twice daily along with\nintermittent Benadryl and famotidine. She does have a letter from a patient advocate in regard to EDS and\nPOTS. She is asking for a looking for several additional workup and evaluations including:\n1. Allergy evaluation. Asking specifically to see the Dr Lapuente in regards to possibility of mast cell\nactivation syndrome. Will work on referral to allergy based on possible reaction to contrast dye. No other\nspecific acute flareups\n2. Ask about referral to cardiology for evaluation of possible POTS. We can work on referral for formal\nassessment with cardiology\n3. Neurology evaluation with Dr Zachary Ward with concerns for headache and muscle tremors. Does\nhave chronic headaches. Will hold on formal neurology evaluation for now pending evaluation with\ncardiology and allergy and then reassess\n4. Dr. Luigi Pascarella for possible vascular workup. Asking specifically about median arcuate ligament\nsyndrome or other vascular compression related to EDS. She complains of ongoing chronic shoulder pain.\nDid have CT angio of the neck which was unremarkable. No other evidence of vascular compromise at this\ntime so we will hold on vascular evaluation\n5. Brown neurosurgery -as needed for evaluation for occult tethered cord due to chronic pain, hyper\nreflexes and bladder dysfunction. No previous symptoms reported consistent with this. Does have history\nof previous spinal fusion at C4-C6. No other specifically reported lower extremity symptoms\n6. Low-dose naltrexone. Letter from a patient advocate requesting this medication, including instructions\nand compounding pharmacy that we will fill it. Will certainly hold at this at this time and reassess after\nallergy and cardiology evaluations. Unfortunately, no one in the area that formally does evaluation for EDS.\nShe reports that she is working on \"national insurance\" to try to see outside specialist\n7. Asking about private genetic testing through a company called Invitae with instructions on how to set up\nand create an account to order this. Will defer at this time. Unfortunately, genetics, neurology, or any other\nprovider in the local area. Does formal evaluation and assessment for EDS\nShe does have ongoing extensive list of chronic symptoms that she reports since 2020 including nausea\nand vomiting, brain fog, difficulty focusing, fatigue, chronic pain, muscle cramps and spasms, temperature\nintolerance and night sweats, intermittent swelling, blurred vision, tachycardia. Previously followed by\npsychiatry for underlying history of anorexia, bipolar and ADD. Was also previously followed by\nrheumatology and manage as possible psoriatic arthritis and more recently unclear inflammatory\npolyarthritis with further evaluation being unremarkable off of all treatments and recommending workup and\nevaluation for fibromyalgia and mental health. Rheumatology did acknowledge hypermobility but they do\nnot treat or manage hypermobility disorders. Again, unfortunately no one in the local area or regionally\neither that evaluates for or will manage or treat EDS.\n*Total time spent on day of encounter reviewing extensive previous records, patient's symptom list as well\nas letter from patient efficacy, face-to-face review and discussion, documentation greater than 75 minutes**\nElectronically signed:\nTimothy P Kennard, MD\n1/17/2025 12:57 PM\nMyChart® licensed from Epic Systems Corporation© 1999 - 2025",

She does\nfeel like some of her symptoms were significantly improved with large amounts of\nantihistamines. She has been taking Claritin and Zyrtec once or twice daily along with\nintermittent Benadryl and famotidine. She does have a letter from a patient advocate in\nregard to EDS and POTS. She is asking for a looking for several additional workup and\nevaluations including:\n1. Allergy evaluation. Asking specifically to see the Dr Lapuente in regards to possibility\nof mast cell activation syndrome. Will work on referral to allergy based on possible\nreaction to contrast dye. No other specific acute flareups\n2. Ask about referral to cardiology for evaluation of possible POTS. We can work on\nreferral for formal assessment with cardiology\n3. Neurology evaluation with Dr Zachary Ward with concerns for headache and muscle\ntremors. Does have chronic headaches. Will hold on formal neurology evaluation for now\npending evaluation with cardiology and allergy and then reassess\n4. Dr. Luigi Pascarella for possible vascular workup. Asking specifically about median\narcuate ligament syndrome or other vascular compression related to EDS. She complains\nof ongoing chronic shoulder pain. Did have CT angio of the neck which was\nunremarkable. No other evidence of vascular compromise at this time so we will hold on\nvascular evaluation\n5. Brown neurosurgery -as needed for evaluation for occult tethered cord due to chronic\npain, hyper reflexes and bladder dysfunction. No previous symptoms reported consistent\nwith this. Does have history of previous spinal fusion at C4-C6. No other specifically\nreported lower extremity symptoms\n6. Low-dose naltrexone. Letter from a patient advocate requesting this medication,\nincluding instructions and compounding pharmacy that we will fill it. Will certainly hold at\nthis at this time and reassess after allergy and cardiology evaluations. Unfortunately, no\none in the area that formally does evaluation for EDS. She reports that she is working on\n\"national insurance\" to try to see outside specialist\n7. Asking about private genetic testing through a company called Invitae with instructions\non how to set up and create an account to order this. Will defer at this time.\nUnfortunately, genetics, neurology, or any other provider in the local area. Does formal\nevaluation and assessment for EDS\nShe does have ongoing extensive list of chronic symptoms that she reports since 2020\nincluding nausea and vomiting, brain fog, difficulty focusing, fatigue, chronic pain, muscle\ncramps and spasms, temperature intolerance and night sweats, intermittent swelling,\nblurred vision, tachycardia. Previously followed by psychiatry for underlying history of\nanorexia, bipolar and ADD. Was also previously followed by rheumatology and manage\nas possible psoriatic arthritis and more recently unclear inflammatory polyarthritis with\nfurther evaluation being unremarkable off of all treatments and recommending workup and\nevaluation for fibromyalgia and mental health. Rheumatology did acknowledge\nhypermobility but they do not treat or manage hypermobility disorders. Again,\nunfortunately no one in the local area or regionally either that evaluates for or will manage\nor treat EDS.\n*Total time spent on day of encounter reviewing extensive previous records, patient's\nsymptom list as well as letter from patient efficacy, face-to-face review and discussion,\ndocumentation greater than 75 minutes**\nElectronically signed:\nTimothy P Kennard, MD\n1/17/2025 12:57 PM\nMyChart® licensed from Epic Systems Corporation© 1999 - 2025\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/app/visits/past-details?csn=WP-24EkKi31kDYevNXG2btOXRCg-3D-3D-24xvEUvRkHN7rjDW5kqDOSb0n7eUIRiGO… 4/5\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n1/20/25, 7:25 PM MyAtriumHealth - Past Visit Details\nhttps://my.atriumhealth.org/myatriumhealth/app/visits/past-details?csn=WP-24EkKi31kDYevNXG2btOXRCg-3D-3D-24xvEUvRkHN7rjDW5kqDOSb0n7eUIRiGO… 5/5",

Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical\nand other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation.\nBackground: 02\nc-KIT is a proto-oncogene that encodes a type III trans-membrane\ntyrosine kinase. c-KIT and its ligand stem cell factor have a key\nrole in survival, proliferation, differentiation and functional\nactivation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. c-KIT mutations are\nreported in nearly all systemic mastocytosis, 20-40% core binding\nfactor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and approximately 20% high\ngrade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and MDS derived AML. c-KIT\nmutation in AML confers increased risk of relapse and decreased\noverall survival. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor, such as Imatinib, has\nbeen evaluated to treat systemic mastocytosis and c-KIT positive AML\nand MDS, and was found effective as single reagent or combination\ntherapy.\nMethodology: 02\nGenomic DNA was purified from the provided specimen. Exon 8 and 17 of\nc-KIT gene coding were subjected to PCR amplification and\nbi-directional sequencing in duplicate to identify sequence\nvariations. This assay has a sensitivity to detect approximately 10%\npopulation of cells containing the c-KIT mutations in a background of\nnon-mutant cells. This assay will not detect the mutation below the\nsensitivity of this assay. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,\nbut as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.\nReference: 02\n1. Care RS. et al. (2003).

See assessment and plan below for my recommendations.\nDr. Pascarella ­ UNC Vascular Surgeon\nDr. Narang ­ GI\nDr. Eisenberg ­ Endocrinology\nDr. Baker ­ Atrium Rheumatology\nDr. Falawee ­ Sanger Cardiology\nASSESSMENT:\nPatient is a 42­year­old female with history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, EDS, POTS, cervical DDD, arthritis, fibromyalgia,\nbulimia/anorexia, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthralgia rheumatica, PTSD, psoriatic arthritis. She is following at UNC for thoracic outlet\nobstruction with significant right shoulder pain.\nShe has been referred for MCAS. She has a myriad of symptoms and is undergoing evaluation for EDS, POTS, MCAS. My goal with\nevaluation is to determine if she has systemic mastocytosis as contributing to her symptoms as a primary bone marrow disorder or if the\nMCAS is secondary/reactive. We turned our discussion toward work​up of systemic mastocytosis. In systemic mastocytosis, tryptase\nlevel is > 20, 70% of the time. There can be indolent and smoldering systemic mastocytosis. Signs and symptoms attributed to acute\nand/or chronic mast cell mediator release or organ infiltration include flushing, pruritis, urticaria, usually with diffuse skin involvement. We\ncan also see nausea, vomiting, bloating, chronic diarrhea, GERD, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and fibromyalgia like diffuse MSK pain,\npain in long bones, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and pathologic fractures. From a Cardiovascular perspective, we can see hypotension,\ntachycardia. You may not always seen evidence or changes in CBC or peripheral blood, though typically would see eosinophilia.\nWe can consider a bone marrow biopsy or punch biopsy of skin lesion at the time of flare to look for c­​kit mutation and tryptase staining\non the marrow, which would confirm a mast cell process driving her symptoms.\nTo diagnose systemic mastocytosis:\nMajor criterion: Multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells (=15 mast cells in aggregates) detected in sections of bone marrow and/or other\nextracutaneous organ(s).\nMinor Criteria: need 3\n1. In biopsy sections of bone marrow or other extracutaneous organs, >25% of the mast cells in the infiltrate are spindle ​shaped or have\natypical morphology or >25% of all mast cells in bone marrow aspirate smears are immature or atypical.\n2. Detection of an activating point mutation at codon 816 of KIT in the bone marrow, blood, or another extracutaneous organ.\n3. Mast cells in bone marrow, blood, or another extracutaneous organ express CD25, with or without CD2, in addition to normal mast\ncell markers.\n4. Serum total tryptase is persistently >20 ng/mL, unless there is an associated myeloid neoplasm, in which case this parameter is not\nvalid.\nAt this time, continue management of MCAS as directed.\nPLAN:\n1. MCAS, hEDS/POTS\nchecking tryptase once off of antihistamines x 4­5 days\nalso checking 24 hour n­methylhistamine in urine\nCARTRETTE, JENNIFER, 9/13/1982 Page 1 of 6\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\nokay to continue antihistamines\nmay consider adding cromolyn, singular\nagree with starting low dose naltrexone\nDr Pascarella ordered CTA head and abdominal aorta with runoff to assess for dissection ­ however, pending at UNC due to contrast\nallergy\nWill order Invitae genetic panel for EDS, remains pending\nplan:\nAdded singulair, Cromolyn\nincrease zyrtec to 2 tabs BID\n2. Fibromyalgia/psoriatic arthritis\nfollowing with rheumatology\n3. Chronic nausea/vomiting\nchecking vitamin/mineral levels\ns/p EGD/colonoscopy with Dr. Narang\ngastric emptying study upcoming\n4.

All other sensory responses in the upper\nextremities were normal.\nMotor NCS in the bilateral upper extremities were normal.\nConcentric needle examination of the Right First Dorsal Interosseous, the Right Pronator Teres, the Right Flexor Pollicis\nLongus, the Right Triceps Brachii, the Right Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, the Right Biceps Brachii, and the Right deltoid muscles\nwere unremarkable.\nElectrophysiological Impression:\nThis is an essentially normal study. The mildly reduced left LAC response does not correlate with any clinical symptoms\nand likely arises from a technical cause and does not represent true pathology. There is no convincing electrodiagnostic\nevidence of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome on either side, compressive mononeuropathies of the upper extremities\non either side, or a right sided cervical radiculopathy.\n_____________________________\nZachary T.

Right arm pain\n2. EDS (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)\n3. Hypermobility arthralgia\n4. Fibromyalgia\nJennifer Beth Cartrette is a 43 y.o. female with hypermobile EDS, MCAS, POTS, Graves' disease involving the right eye,\nfibromyalgia, bilateral vascular TOS, cervical DDD s/p C4-C6 ACDF (8/2018), Bipolar 1, ADHD, Bullemia, high\nfunctioning autism spectrum disorder who was referred for possible right sided cervical radiculopathy after findings of\nright sided C6-C7 NFS on MRI of the neck. She does report pain in the right ACF and some numbness and tingling\nalong the right pinky and hypothenar wrist. Strength exam and reflexes are symmetric bilaterally. NCS/EMG (11/2025)\nshowed no convincing electrodiagnostic evidence of a right sided cervical radiculopathy and no evidence of neurogenic\nTOS on either side. We spent a little bit of time talking about her POTS symptoms, possible toe curling dystonia and\ndysautonomia, but we will come back to that at her next visit in 3 months as this visit was more focused on the right\ncervical radiculopathy. She is seeing vascular for vTOS, GI for slow transit, Cardiology for possible POTS, Endo for\nGraves, and Rheumatology for fibromyalgia (tried treatment for psoriatric arthritis, which did not help) and planning to\nundergo GI workup and possible breast reduction surgery\nPlan\n--No motor root involving cervical radiculopathy or brachial plexopathy seen on todays electrodiagnostic testing\n--Will talk more in depth about possibility of hypermobile EDS related POTS at next visit to see if a trial of mestinon,\nmidodrine, or propranolol makes any sense\n12\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\n--The toe curling does not bother her sufficiently to pursue BOTOX\nHPI\n--Reports that symptoms started with neck pain in 2018 which led to C4-C6 ACDF\n--Following the surgery she developed ulcerative lesions on the face which at 1 point tested positive for staph. This\nwould later be diagnosed as mast cell activation disorder (MCAS) for which she has tried cromolyn and multiple rounds\nof antibiotics\n--She started to develop orthostatic symptoms at that time such as lightheadedness, palpitations, and dizziness in the\nupright position, exacerbated by things that would expand her blood volume such as hot showers. She was told that this\nmight be POTS, but she has since established with a cardiologist who is doubting that diagnosis with normal orthostatic\nvitals and reportedly normal tilt table. She did report symptoms worsened when she switched to XR Adderal and\ndecreased the dosage\n--She additionally developed venous congestion symptoms in the upper extremities. She would note worsening pains\nand numbness/tingling that would develop when she kept her arms down at her side or behind her. She can also\ndevelop numbness and tingling if she rapidly squeezes her hands above head level.\n--She also notes toe curling postures of the right foot. She was told that this might be dystonia and notes that the small\ntoe stay in a curled position most of the time. Sometimes it feels like the hands want to do the same\n--On ROS she does note a number of autonomic symptoms. She has dry eyes that causes severe blurriness. It is\nworse in the right eye where she had Graves' disease previously. She notes very poor night vision. She also reports\nthat she has very dry mouth and lost all of her teeth because of this. She also has dry skin with difficulty in sweating.\nShe reports that she does get stasis of food when she eats and feels like food just sticks in her stomach and does not\nmove forward. She has alternating constipation and diarrhea, partially attributable to her diet. She notes urinary\nurgency, feeling like her bladder does not tell her she needs to go until its almost too late.\n--Undergoing gastric emptying study with GI to workup the slow transit\n-- When asked about cervical radicular symptoms in the right arm she reports that she has pain in the right antecubital\nfossa and numbness and tingling along the right pinky and into the hyperthenar aspect of the right wrist. She does not\nhave any significant weakness outside of the hands. She does not note neck pain that travels down the arm.\nPMHX: Hypermobile EDS, MCAS with chronic urticaria, POTS, Graves' disease involving the right eye, fibromyalgia,\nlymphocytic and ischemic colitis, bilateral vascular TOS, cervical DDD s/p C4-C6 ACDF (8/2018), Bipolar 1, ADHD,\nBullemia, high functioning autism spectrum disorder\nSocial History: Disabled as of 2022.
