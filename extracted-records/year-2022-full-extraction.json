Both\nmarkers of inflammation were within normal ranges.\nBecause of these normal lab results, starting a stronger immune\nsuppressing medication would not be recommended. We could\nconsider starting a medication such as hydroxychloroquine to\nmonitor your response. This is a medication that is not an\nimmune suppressing medication, but is a medication that can\ntake a number of months to build up in your system and take\neffect.
